   <h2>About the Mongolia</h2>
   <p>Mongolia (/mɒnˈɡoʊliə/ (About this soundlisten), <i> Монгол Улс, transcription: Mongol Uls, </i> Traditional Mongolian: <em>ᠮᠤᠩᠭᠤᠯ ᠤᠯᠤᠰ, transliteration: </em> Mongγol ulus)
       is a landlocked country in East Asia. Its asrea is roughly equivalent with the historical territory of Outer Mongolia, and that term is sometimes used to refer 
       to the current state. It is sandwiched between Russia to the north and China to the south, where it neighbours the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Mongolia 
       does not share a border with Kazakhstan, although only 37 kilometres (23 mi) separate them. (the informatin form

   <h3>Climate</h3>
   <p>Mongolia is known as the <strong>"Land of the Eternal Blue Sky"</strong> or <strong>"Country of Blue Sky"</strong> (Mongolian: "Mönkh khökh tengeriin oron") because it
       has over 250 sunny days a year.[54][55][56][57] Mongolia map of Köppen climate classification zones. Most of the country is hot in the summer 
       and extremely cold in the winter, wsith January averages dropping as low as −30 °C (−22 °F).[58] A vast front of cold, heavy, shallow air comes in from Siberia in winter 
       and collects in river valleys and low basins causing very cold temperatures while slopes of mountains are much warmer due to 
       the effects of temperature inversion (temperature increases with altitude). </p>
